// A crack team of love scientists from OkEros (a hot new dating site) have devised a way to represent dating profiles as rectangles on a two-dimensional plane.
// They need help writing an algorithm to find the intersection of two users' love rectangles. They suspect finding that intersection is the key to a matching algorithm so powerful it will cause an immediate acquisition by Google or Facebook or Obama or something.
// Two rectangles overlapping a little. It must be love.
// Write a function to find the rectangular intersection of two given love rectangles.
// As with the example above, love rectangles are always "straight" and never "diagonal." More rigorously: each side is parallel with either the x-axis or the y-axis.
// They are defined as dictionaries like this:

// const my_rectangle = {
//   leftX: 1,
//   bottomY: 1,
//   width: 6,
//   height: 3
// }

// Your output rectangle should use this format as well.
