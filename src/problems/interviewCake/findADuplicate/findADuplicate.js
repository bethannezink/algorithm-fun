// We have an array of integers, where:

// The integers are in the range 1..n1..n
// The array has a length of n+1n+1
// It follows that our array has at least one integer which appears at least twice.
// But it may have several duplicates, and each duplicate may appear more than twice.

// Write a function which finds an integer that appears more than once in our array.
// (If there are multiple duplicates, you only need to find one of them.)

// We're going to run this function on our new, super-hip MacBook Pro With Retina Displayâ„¢.
// Thing is, the damn thing came with the RAM soldered right to the motherboard, so we can't
// upgrade our RAM. So we need to optimize for space!

// function findADuplicate (array) {
//   for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
//     isInArray(integer, array);
//   }
// }

// function isInArray (element, array) {
//   if (array.length === 1) {

//   }

//   let midElement = Math.floor(array.length / 2);
// }
